# LeetCode Daily Practice
This repository tracks my daily progress in solving LeetCode problems. Each day, I aim to tackle at least one new problem, reinforcing my understanding of algorithms and data structures, and honing my problem-solving skills.

# Why LeetCode?
LeetCode provides an excellent platform for:
- Improving algorithmic thinking: Understanding common patterns and efficient approaches to solve complex problems.
- Mastering data structures: Gaining hands-on experience with arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, and more.
- Preparing for technical interviews: Practicing frequently asked interview questions from top tech companies.
- Consistent coding practice: Building a habit of daily coding and problem-solving.

# Progress Tracking
I'll be pushing my solutions to this repository daily (or as frequently as possible) to maintain a consistent practice log. You can observe my progress through the commit history.

# Goals
- Solve at least one LeetCode problem every day.
- Explore different problem categories (e.g., arrays, dynamic programming, trees, graphs).
- Optimize solutions for better time and space complexity.
- Document my thought process and understanding for each problem.
